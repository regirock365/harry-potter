C++ Project for Software Engineering
Design: This is a 2-player Harry Potter Dueling Game based on the classic pokemon format. Each player selects their
wizard avatar and battles it out to decide who is the the duelling champion!
First Step: Player 1 and Player 2 Select their characters
Second Step: Player 1 chooses their spell
Third Step: player 2 choses their spell
Fourth Step: The result of the prior 2 steps will be displayed 
Fifth Step: Steps 2-4 are repeated until one wizard faints
Sixth Step: The Last Wizard standing is crowned Dueling Champion

Testing: This game relies heavily on human interaction, so there is possibility for error at every step.
To reduce chance of crashing and for game to be user-friendly we have attempted to keep the inputs simple at every stage.
At each stage we have attempted inputing invalid values and seen what happens at edge cases (both wizards faint on the same move
or ...
The Game has not crashed whenever this occurs.

Enjoy!
